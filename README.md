#Setting up the environment<br>
The project uses sass to create css-files. Use "npm i sass" to install required packages.

If you want to use icons, you must install fontawesome packages.

Otherwise the site uses only static html pages and css and does not need any other specific setting.

.gitignore excludes all generally available packages. It is not included in the GitHub repository.

Website is deployed to github.io and can be found on https://sjormala.github.io/front-end-course/index.html
